        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Pho is a Vietnamese soup consisting of broth, rice noodles, herbs, and meat. It is a popular street food in Vietnam and the specialty of a number of restaurant chains around the world. Pho is primarily served with either beef or chicken. The Hanoi and Saigon styles of pho differ by noodle width, sweetness of broth, and choice of herbs. The origin of pho and its name is a subject of scholarly debate. The traditional home of pho is reputed to be the villages of Van Cu and Dao Cung in the Nam Dinh Province. According to villagers, pho was eaten in Van Cu long before the French colonial period when it was popularized. The origins of pho are relatively unrecorded, and there is little agreement over the cultural influences that led to its development in Vietnam, although it is likely that the dish was brought over </p>
